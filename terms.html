                    from our SMS marketing.

                    Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and
                    construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Nevada

                    Arbitration. ANY DISPUTE, CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM ARISING OUT
                    OF, RELATING TO OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT,
                    INCLUDING THE BREACH, TERMINATION OR VALIDITY THEREOF, SHALL
                    BE FINALLY RESOLVED BY ARBITRATION OR SMALL CLAIMS COURT.
                    The arbitration tribunal shall have the power to rule on any
                    challenge to its own jurisdiction or to the validity or
                    enforceability of any portion of the agreement to arbitrate.
                    THE PARTIES AGREE TO ARBITRATE SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL
                    BASIS, AND THAT THIS AGREEMENT DOES NOT PERMIT CLASS
                    ARBITRATION OR ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS
                    MEMBER IN ANY CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ARBITRATION
                    PROCEEDING. The arbitration may take place in the consumer's
                    home county and may be conducted by phone at consumer's
                    election. We will cover the costs of arbitration. The
                    arbitral tribunal may not consolidate more than one person's
                    claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a
                    representative or class proceeding. In the event the
                    prohibition on class arbitration is deemed invalid or
                    unenforceable, then the remaining portions of the
                    arbitration agreement will remain in force, except in the
                    event that class arbitration is requested, in which case the
                    entire agreement to arbitrate will be null and void.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Non-Arbitration Forum; Venue. In the event that a challenge
                    to the jurisdiction of the arbitrator or a challenge to the
                    validity or enforceability of any portion of the agreement
                    to arbitrate is sustained, the parties irrevocably and
                    unconditionally submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
                    courts of the State of Nevada located in Clark County or in
                    the United States District Court for the District of Nevada
                    for the purposes of any suit, action or other proceeding
                    arising out of this Agreement or the subject matter hereof
                    brought by any party hereto; and hereby waive and agree not
                    to assert as a defense or otherwise, in any such suit,
                    action or proceeding, any claim that it is not subject
                    personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts,
                    that the suit, action or proceeding is brought in an
                    inconvenient forum, or that the venue of the suit, action or
                    proceeding is improper.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Waiver of Jury Trial and Class Suit. You acknowledge and
                    understand that, with respect to any dispute with us, our
                    affiliates, employees, officers, directors and members
                    relating to or arising from your use of the Site or this
                    Agreement that YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO HAVE A TRIAL
                    BY JURY AND YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO SERVE AS A
                    REPRESENTATIVE, AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR IN ANY
                    OTHER REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY, OR TO PARTICIPATE AS A MEMBER
                    OF A CLASS OF CLAIMANTS, IN ANY LAWSUIT INVOLVING SUCH
                    DISPUTE.

                    Miscellaneous. All covenants, agreements, representations
                    and warranties made in this Agreement shall survive your
                    acceptance of this Agreement and the termination of this
                    Agreement.
                  </p>

                    Construction. The titles of the sections of this Agreement
                    are for convenience of reference only and are not to be
                    considered in construing any meanings contained in this
                    Agreement. Unless the context of this Agreement clearly
                    requires otherwise: (i) references to the plural include the
                    singular, the singular the plural, and the part the whole,
                    (ii) references to one gender include all genders, (iii)
                    "or" has the inclusive meaning frequently identified with
                    the phrase "and/or," (iv) "including" has the inclusive
                    meaning frequently identified with the phrase "including but
                    not limited to" or "including without limitation," and (v)
                    references to "hereunder," "herein" or "hereof" relate to
                    this Agreement as a whole. Any reference in this Agreement
                    to any statute, rule, regulation or agreement, including
                    this Agreement, shall be deemed to include such statute,
                    rule, regulation or agreement as it may be modified, varied,
                    amended or supplemented from time to time. The parties agree
                    that this Agreement shall be fairly interpreted in
                    accordance with its terms without any strict construction in
                    favor of or against either party, and that ambiguities shall
                    not be interpreted against the drafting party.

                  <p>
                    Attorneys' Fees. If a challenge to the jurisdiction of the
                    arbitrator or a challenge to the validity or enforceability
                    of any portion of the agreement to arbitrate is sustained
                    and a lawsuit between you and us is necessary in order to
                    enforce any of the terms of this Agreement, the prevailing
                    party in any such action shall be entitled to recover its
                    reasonable attorneys' fees and costs from the non-prevailing
                    party.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Relationship. This Agreement creates no agency, partnership,
                    joint venture, or employee-employer relationship between you
                    and us, unless otherwise stated in writing by us.

                  <p>
                    Entire Agreement. This Agreement sets forth the entire
                    agreement of the parties, and supersedes any prior agreement
                    and any prior discussion between the parties, relating to
                    the subject matter contained herein. Neither party shall be
                    bound by any definition, condition, provision,
                    representation, warranty, covenant or promise other than as
                    expressly stated in this Agreement or as contemporaneously
                    or subsequently set forth in writing and signed by a duly
                    authorized officer or representative of the party to be
                    bound thereby.
