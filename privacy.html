                  <h4>2. INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT</h4>

                  <p>
                    We collect two types of information from you. The first type
                    is Personal Data that you actively choose to disclose and
                    the second type is anonymous aggregate information collected
                    in a manner not visible to you or others visiting the Site
                    ("Passive Information").
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    a. Personal Data. Examples of Personal Data that you may
                    provide include your first and last name, email address,
                    home address and zip code. It is not necessary for you to
                    provide Personal Data in order to read content that is
                    publicly available at the Site. In providing Personal Data,
                    you consent and agree to allow it to be shared with
                    third-parties for commercial marketing purposes as well as
                    to third party service providers as we deem necessary in
                    order to fulfill any requests you make for information,
                    products and services. If you provide Personal Data to us,
                    you may later request to have it suppressed and removed from
                    all future marketing activities by us, by following the
                    opt-out procedures set forth above.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    b. Passive Information. We record information relating to
                    your use of the Site, such as the information you click on,
                    your browser type, IP address, referring URL and timestamp
                    information. We use this type of information to administer
                    the Site and increase our level of service to you. We may
                    also use this information in the aggregate to perform
                    statistical analyses of user behavior and characteristics in
                    order to measure interest in and use of various areas of the
                    Site.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    In order to maintain the accuracy of the information
                    collected (including your Personal Data) we may adopt such
                    necessary measures to verify and update such data using
                    commonly acceptable practices, or as may be recommended by
                    the Privacy Commissioner of Personal Data in United States
                    from time to time.
                  </p>

                  <p>

                    DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AS DESCRIBED IN THIS
                    POLICY. USERS ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY LOSS OF

                    DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL DATA.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    We may offer text advertising, affiliate and push
                    notification advertising, display advertising and other
                    commercial services to third party companies. We may receive

                    register or purchase products and services from such third
                    parties.
                  </p>

                    Please note that we can only control our own mailing list,

                    responsible for the marketing, communication or business

                    stop receiving communications from them.
